## 🧠 Project Summary

Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures with strong potential for future memory and logic devices. This project aims to:

- Simulate skyrmion behavior under current pulses and boundary conditions
- Use COMSOL and MuMax3 for multi-scale modeling
- Preprocess and visualize skyrmion trajectories
- Explore machine learning methods for trajectory prediction and phase classification

## 🔧 Tools & Platforms

- **COMSOL Multiphysics** (.mph files)
- **MuMax3** (GPU-based micromagnetics)
- **Python + NumPy/Pandas/Matplotlib**
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks**
