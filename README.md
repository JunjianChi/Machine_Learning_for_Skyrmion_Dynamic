## 🧠 Project Summary

Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures with strong potential for future memory and logic devices. This project aims to:

- Simulate skyrmion behavior under current pulses and boundary conditions
- Use COMSOL and MuMax3 for multi-scale modeling
- Preprocess and visualize skyrmion trajectories
- Explore machine learning methods for trajectory prediction and phase classification
